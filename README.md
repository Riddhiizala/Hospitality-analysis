# Hospitality-analysis
 
## Company Overview
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


In this project, I have acted as the service provider, utilizing Power BI to perform a detailed analysis of AtliQ Grand's data and generate valuable insights.


## Project overview

### Performance view
- Snapshot of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), and occupancy percentage.
- Detailed metrics including average daily rates (ADR) & total bookings.

### Revenue view
- Analysis of revenue breakdowns across cities, hotel categories, and booking platforms.
- Insights aimed at optimizing sales strategies and improving revenue streams.
